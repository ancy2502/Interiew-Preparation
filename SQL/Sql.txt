1.What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clause?
WHERE: Filters rows before grouping (GROUP BY).

HAVING: Filters groups after aggregation.

Clause	Usage Context	               Filters On
WHERE	Before grouping (GROUP BY)	Rows
HAVING	After grouping (GROUP BY)	Groups/Aggregates

📘 Sample Table: Sales
id	region	product	amount
1	East	A	100
2	East	B	200
3	West	A	150
4	West	B	300
5	East	A	250

 Using WHERE (filters rows before grouping)
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
WHERE product = 'A'     -- filters rows before grouping
GROUP BY region;

 What it does:
First filters only rows where product is 'A'.
Then groups by region.
Then calculates the SUM(amount).

🧾 Result:

region	total_sales
East	350
West	150

 Using HAVING (filters rows after grouping)

SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(amount) > 400;   -- filters groups based on aggregation

 What it does:
Groups all rows by region.
Then calculates SUM(amount) per region.
Then filters groups where total is greater than 400.

 Result:
region	total_sales
West	450

| ------- | ------- |
| 1       | Alice   |
| 2       | Bob     |
| 3       | Charlie |
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE emp_id = 2; // Only Bob is removed.
TRUNCATE – TRUNCATE TABLE Employees; // All rows are deleted. Table remains. IDENTITY is reset (starts from 1 again).
DROP TABLE Employees; //Entire table Employees is removed from the database.

5. What is a Primary Key vs Foreign Key?
Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each record. Not null.
Foreign Key: Refers to Primary Key of another table. Maintains referential integrity. 

6. What is Normalization? What are 1NF, 2NF, 3NF?

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to:
Minimize redundancy (duplicate data)
Improve data integrity
It divides larger tables into smaller, related tables and uses keys to link them.

 Benefits of Normalization:
Removes data redundancy
Ensures data consistency
Makes maintenance easier
1NF (First Normal Form)
Rule:Each column should contain atomic (indivisible) values.Each record should be unique.
| Student\_ID | Name  | Course  |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| 1           | Alice | Math    |
| 1           | Alice | English |
| 2           | Bob   | Physics |

2NF (Second Normal Form)
Rule:

Must be in 1NF.
| Student\_ID | Course  | Instructor |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1           | Math    | Mr. A      |
| 1           | English | Mr. A      |
 3NF (Third Normal Form)
Rule:

Must be in 2NF.
-- Students
Student_ID | Name   | Department
-----------|--------|-----------
1          | Alice  | CS

-- Departments
Department | Dept_HOD
-----------|---------
CS         | Dr. John

 What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to communicate with databases. It is used for storing, retrieving, managing, and manipulating data in relational databases.

 SQL vs NoSQL

SQL (Relational): Structured schema, tables with rows & columns, supports JOINs. E.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL
NoSQL (Non-relational): Schema-less, used for unstructured data, scalable. E.g., MongoDB, Cassandra

DBMS vs RDBMS

DBMS: Manages databases, stores data.
RDBMS: Based on relational model, uses tables and relationships. Supports SQL.

Constraints

Enforce rules on data
Types: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT



SQL Commands

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP
DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

SELECT Command	
SELECT * FROM Employees;
SELECT name, salary FROM Employees WHERE salary > 50000;

CRUD Operations

Create: INSERT INTO
Read: SELECT
Update: UPDATE
Delete: DELETE

Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

COUNT(): Returns the number of rows
SUM(): Returns the total sum
AVG(): Returns the average
MAX(): Returns the highest value
MIN(): Returns the lowest value

-- Count number of employees
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
-- Sum of all salaries
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees;
-- Average salary
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees;
-- Highest salary
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees;
-- Lowest salary
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees;

Index:
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Employees(name);
20. Types of Keys

Primary Key
Foreign Key
Candidate Key
Composite Key
Super Key
Alternate Key

 UNION vs UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM A UNION SELECT name FROM B;      -- removes duplicates
SELECT name FROM A UNION ALL SELECT name FROM B;  -- keeps duplicates

 CASE Statement Example:
SELECT name, salary,
  CASE
    WHEN salary > 80000 THEN 'High'
    WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Low'
  END AS Salary_Level
FROM Employees;

Find the Second Largest Salary:
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighest
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees);

Count Rows with Same 'country' in 'people' Table:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM people
GROUP BY country;

 Join Two Tables Using JOIN:
SELECT E.name, D.department_name
FROM Employees E
JOIN Departments D ON E.dept_id = D.id;

 Department Name and Avg Salary:
SELECT D.department_name, AVG(E.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Employees E
JOIN Departments D ON E.dept_id = D.id
GROUP BY D.department_name;

 Update 'salary' Where 'job_des' = 'admin'
UPDATE Employees
SET salary = salary + 1000
WHERE job_des = 'admin';

DDL: CREATE, ALTER, DELETE Examples:
Create a Table:
CREATE TABLE Employees (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10,2),
  department_id INT
);

Add Constraints:
CREATE TABLE Students (
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
Add New Column:
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD job_title VARCHAR(50);

Rename a Column (example for MySQL):
ALTER TABLE Employees
CHANGE COLUMN name full_name VARCHAR(100);

Delete Table:
DROP TABLE Employees;


DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE Examples
Insert a Row:
INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, name, salary, department_id)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 55000, 2);

Update a Cell:
UPDATE Employees
SET salary = 60000
WHERE emp_id = 1;

Delete a Column (remove column):
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP COLUMN job_title;

Max, 2nd Max, Min, 2nd Min Salary:
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees;
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees;

SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees);

SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees);

ORDER BY Salary Ascending & Descending:
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY salary ASC;
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

Sum of Cars Under a Model Name:
SELECT model_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_cars
FROM Cars
GROUP BY model_name;

First Name Starting with 'Do':
SELECT * FROM People
WHERE firstname LIKE 'Do%';

Add 'age' Column and Set Values to 20:
ALTER TABLE People ADD age INT;
UPDATE People SET age = 20;

Delete All Rows with Gender 'Female':
DELETE FROM People WHERE gender = 'Female';

Join Two Tables Using JOIN:	
SELECT Orders.order_id, Customers.name
FROM Orders
JOIN Customers ON Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id;
